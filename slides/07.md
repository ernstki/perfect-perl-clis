## [07] Ten recommendations for user-friendly CLIs (cont'd)

5. Always raise an error if something goes wrong (`or die`!)

6. Validate your parameters (Getopt::Long can do this!)

7. Don't hard-code any paths (no "magic variables" as the boss would say)

8. Don't pollute the `PATH` (corrollary: install into the `$PATH`).

    * provide a standard `Makefile.PL`

    * provide a `Makefile` that installs to `~/.local`

    * look into something like [Environment Modules][7.1]

9. Check that your dependencies are installed.

10. Don't distribute bare JAR files. (Ha!)

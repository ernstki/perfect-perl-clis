## [09] POD to man pages

Unix man pages are grrreat. Their lack of features is a feature.

POD is basically a man page with slightly different section names from the
Unix / POSIX standard. They show up in section "3pm" of the manual.

You can access them with `man cmdname` or `perldoc cmdname`.

You can process POD from a Perl module into a man page with `pod2man`.

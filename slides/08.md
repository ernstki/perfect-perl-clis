## [08] What does it mean to be a "filter"?

Take the example script `scrubbed`: it reads (potentially malformed) input and
writes sanitized output.

It has a name ("scrub") that suggests it behaves like a filter: reading from
and writing to standard out.

Some Unix toolkit programs (`cat`, `awk`, `grep`) will appear to "hang" if you
forget the input filename.

You can either handle this one of two ways:

  * by requiring `-` as the input filename to read from stdin

  * by waiting for input (forever)

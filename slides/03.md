## [03] What does "discoverability" mean for CLIs?

* will it show up if I `man -k somekeyword`?

    * (probably not, because `mkwhatis` only works on system paths)

* will it show up if I `something[Tab]`?

* does it _do_ something (besides crash) if I run it w/ no options?

* does it have a `--help` option?

  * does **that** guide me toward (more) help?

* does it behave like other programs I'm used to?

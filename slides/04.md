## [04] What does it mean to be a "Unix program"?

* Don't try to do things that other standard Unix utils already do

    * _e.g._, sorting, printing matching lines

* Use linefeed-delimited text streams as your IPC/RPC

    * read from standard input when used in a pipe

    * write **normal** (expected, requested) output to standard output

    * write **exceptional** output to standard error

* Return zero for success, non-zero for failure

* Have a manual page (it's cake with `pod2man`)

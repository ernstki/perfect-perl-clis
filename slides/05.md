## [05] The situation for Perl

Perl *is* part of the Unix toolkit.

[pod2man][5.1] comes with Perl and makes it easy to

  * turn POD into a manual page

  * so your users can `man yourcmd` just like any other

[Getopt::Long][5.2] and [Pod::Usage][5.3] make it easy to

  * parse command line options the conventional way

  * produce nicely-formatted, standard-looking `--help` output
